The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the PetBnB platform, transitioning from an initial MVP mindset to a full production-ready build as per user's explicit request. Key phases included foundational setup, comprehensive backend and frontend scaffolding, and critical API integrations (Google Maps, Stripe, Cloudinary, Gmail SMTP). The web application was brought to a functional state, featuring a user authentication flow, basic dashboards, and search capabilities, all styled with a new Airbnb-inspired theme and integrated user-provided logo. A significant pivot occurred towards the end, where the user requested direct React Native development instead of a PWA. The AI engineer, after initial assessment of environment limitations, proceeded to set up the Expo/React Native environment and commenced scaffolding the mobile application's core screens, demonstrating a commitment to the user's long-term vision despite environmental challenges. The work concluded with the mobile app's initial structure in place.

The user aims to build a comprehensive, production-ready PetBnB Platform, akin to Airbnb, for pet boarding and services. The platform targets Malaysia and Singapore, operating on a commission-based revenue model. It requires a FastAPI backend and a React Native mobile application for Android and iOS.

Core features requested include:
*   **Authentication & User Management:** JWT with refresh tokens, email verification (Gmail SMTP preferred), password reset, Google social login, role-based access (Pet Owner, Caregiver, Admin), identity/background verification for caregivers.
*   **User & Pet Profile Management:** Detailed profiles for owners (personal info, photo, emergency contacts, comm. methods) and caregivers (bio, experience, service area, availability, pricing, portfolio, certifications, insurance, background status). Pet profiles with multi-pet support, medical/behavioral info, photos, and CRUD operations.
*   **Caregiver Service System:** Diverse service types (boarding, walking, grooming, etc.), CRUD for services, pricing/packages, add-ons, capacity, calendar-based availability, minimum advance booking.
*   **Advanced Search & Discovery:** Location-based search (Google Maps integration), advanced filters (service, price, pet compatibility, ratings, distance), map/list views, favorites, recently viewed.
*   **Comprehensive Booking System:** Service/pet selection, special requirements, price calculation, payment processing, booking status tracking, automatic/manual confirmations, modifications, reminder notifications, dynamic pricing.
*   **Payment System Integration:** Stripe (international), local gateways (iPay88, MOLPay, Boost, GrabPay, DuitNow for Malaysia; PayNow, GrabPay, NETS for Singapore), bank transfer, digital wallets, secure processing, payment hold, auto-payouts, refunds, transaction history, invoice generation, commission deduction, multi-currency (MYR, SGD).
*   **Real-time Messaging System:** WebSocket/Socket.io, encryption, media sharing, message history, unread indicators, push notifications.
*   **Review & Rating System:** Dual review (ownerâ†”caregiver), 5-star rating with categories, photo reviews, responses, moderation, fake review detection.
*   **Notification System:** Push, email, and SMS notifications for various platform activities.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** User/content management, analytics/reporting, system configuration.

User explicitly opted for a production-ready build over an MVP and provided API keys for Google Maps, Stripe, and Cloudinary. They later requested an Airbnb-like color theme and confirmed intent for React Native mobile app conversion, emphasizing scalability.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT (Authentication), OAuth (Google), Gmail SMTP, Cloudinary (Image Upload), Stripe (Payments).
-   **Frontend:** React (Web), React Native (Mobile), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI Components, Google Maps API,  (API calls).
-   **Architecture:** Full-stack, microservices-oriented (implied by separate backend/frontend), RESTful APIs, WebSocket (planned for messaging).
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor (process manager).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo-like structure, with distinct  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories, and a newly initialized  (React Native/Expo) directory.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Updated to include , , , , , , and . These are crucial for external service integrations.
*   : Updated to include , , , and . These provide the frontend access to necessary API keys for client-side operations.
*   : Initial comprehensive backend structure generated. This file is the core of the FastAPI application, containing API routes, database models, and logic for authentication, user management, and other core features. Its initial generation was a significant step.
*   : Main React component. It was initially generated to set up routing and global contexts (Auth, Toast) and later modified to integrate the  and  components.
*   : Global CSS file. Modified to adopt the Airbnb color scheme ( and  variables were changed to  and  respectively) and other related color variables for dark/light themes. This change was critical for the visual identity.
*   : Initial component for navigation, later updated to incorporate the PetBnB logo and use Airbnb theme colors for navigation active states.
*   : Landing page. Modified to integrate the PetBnB logo and apply the new Airbnb color scheme to elements like the hero section's Pet Care text, using a coral gradient.
*   : Handles user login/registration. Updated to integrate the PetBnB logo and style role selection and form elements with the Airbnb theme.
*   : Application footer. Updated to use the PetBnB logo.
*   : Component for displaying search results. Initially had a compilation error with Google Maps import which was fixed by replacing it with  and using a simple map placeholder.
*   : New file created to provide visual feedback during data loading, improving user experience.
*   : New file for a custom toast notification system, integrated into  and designed for user feedback.
*   : New file providing a dedicated modal form for pet owners to add new pet profiles, including form handling. Integrated into .
*   : New file for a modal form allowing caregivers to create new service listings. Integrated into .
*    and : Provide global state management for authentication and toast notifications across the React web app.
*   : New directory, initialized as an Expo React Native project. This signifies the pivot towards mobile app development.
*   : Main React Native component, configured for navigation using  and integrating  and  for the mobile app.
*   : Centralized Axios instance for API calls in the React Native app, designed to reuse backend integration logic.
*   : Contains initial placeholder screens for the React Native application, including , , , , , and . These are crucial for building the mobile UI.

Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer was focused on transitioning the project to a React Native mobile application. Despite initial concerns about environment limitations, the user insisted on proceeding with a full React Native migration.

The AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Installed necessary React Native development tools:** , , etc., within the environment.
2.  **Initialized a new Expo React Native project:** Named  at . This created the basic directory structure and configuration files for a new mobile application.
3.  **Installed core React Native dependencies:** This included , , , , and , which are foundational for navigation and API communication in React Native.
4.  **Scaffolded initial React Native application structure:**
    *   Created the main  file for the mobile app, setting up  and  within the React Native environment, along with a new  service for backend communication.
    *   Began creating placeholder screens for the mobile application under . So far, , , , , , and  have been created.

The work concluded with the AI engineer in the process of creating additional placeholder screens and attempting to start the React Native development server, indicating the shift from web optimization to direct mobile app development is actively underway, with the foundational structure for the mobile app now in place.
