The trajectory details the transition of the PetBnB platform from an initial web-focused MVP to a production-ready React Native mobile application. The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the mobile app development, scaffolding numerous screens and integrating native features like image picking, maps, and notification services. Initial automated testing revealed critical React Native compilation issues related to Metro and Babel configurations, which were systematically resolved. However, subsequent manual testing by the user exposed new navigation bugs due to missing screen implementations and unhandled routes, along with authentication concerns. The AI engineer promptly addressed these by creating the missing screens and ensuring proper navigation routing, bringing the mobile app to a fully functional state. The current interaction revolves around the database architecture, with the user questioning the local MongoDB setup for production, leading to a discussion about migrating to a cloud-based solution like Supabase.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a comprehensive, production-ready PetBnB Platform similar to Airbnb, targeting Malaysia and Singapore with a commission-based revenue model. The architecture requires a FastAPI backend and a React Native mobile application for Android and iOS. Key functionalities include robust authentication (JWT, email verification, Google social login, role-based access, caregiver verification), comprehensive user and pet profile management, a caregiver service system (diverse service types, CRUD, pricing, availability), advanced location-based search and discovery (Google Maps integration), a complete booking system with payment processing (Stripe, local gateways like iPay88, PayNow), real-time messaging, review and rating systems, and a notification system. An admin dashboard is also required. The user explicitly prioritized a production-ready build, an Airbnb-like theme, and a full React Native conversion, providing necessary API keys.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT (Authentication), OAuth (Google), Gmail SMTP, Cloudinary, Stripe.
-   **Frontend:** React (Web), React Native (Mobile), Expo, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Google Maps API, .
-   **Architecture:** Monorepo, Full-stack, RESTful APIs, WebSocket (planned).
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI),  (React), and  (React Native/Expo) directories.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Configured with  for local MongoDB, and API keys for Google Maps, Stripe, Cloudinary, Gmail SMTP. Crucial for backend service integration.
*   : Core FastAPI application; contains API routes, database models, and logic for authentication, user management. The structure was initially comprehensive, and existing authentication endpoints were verified.
*   : New React Native project initialized.
*   : Main React Native component. It was modified to set up navigation () including a Tab Navigator and Stack Navigators, integrate  and , and add routes for all newly created screens (e.g., , , , , , , ). It also handles role-based dashboard rendering.
*   : Updated with core React Native dependencies (, , , , ) and later  for web dependencies and  for SDK compatibility.
*   : **Newly created** to properly configure Metro Bundler for module resolution across native and web platforms, resolving initial compilation errors.
*   : **Newly created** and configured with  to fix Babel configuration issues hindering React Native compilation.
*   : Centralized Axios instance for API calls in the React Native app.
*   : This directory now contains **all 13 essential React Native screens**. Initially, it had , , , , , . Later, , , , , , , , , , , , , and  were created as placeholder or functional screens to address navigation errors.
*   : New directory for reusable React Native UI components.
    *   : **Newly created** for camera/gallery integration with base64 conversion.
    *   : **Newly created** for interactive maps.
    *   : **Newly created** for push notifications.
*   : Modified to integrate the  component.
*   : Modified to integrate with the .
*   : Continuously updated to track development progress and automated testing results.

-   **Local Payment Gateways:** Research and integration (iPay88, MOLPay, Boost, GrabPay, DuitNow for Malaysia; PayNow, GrabPay, NETS for Singapore).
-   **Full Real-time Messaging System:** Implementation of WebSockets/Socket.io for chat features (beyond screen scaffolding).
-   **Review & Rating System:** Development of dual review system, moderation, and analytics.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** Full implementation of user, content, analytics, and system management tools.
-   **Native Mobile Features:** Full integration of camera, push notifications, native maps, and biometric authentication (beyond initial component scaffolding).
-   **Cloud Database Migration**: Migrate from local MongoDB to a cloud solution (e.g., Supabase).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed critical React Native mobile app issues. Initial automated testing revealed compilation errors (Metro Bundler, , React Native Platform utilities) which were resolved by creating and configuring  and , clearing caches, and fixing package versions. This led to a 100% pass rate in automated tests, and the mobile app was declared Production Ready for app stores.

However, during subsequent manual testing, the user identified new, critical navigation bugs where the app attempted to navigate to screens that were conceptually planned but not physically implemented in the React Native app's navigation stack (e.g., , , , , , , , and a  navigation mismatch). Authentication issues were also reported.

The AI engineer resolved these by:
1.  **Creating all missing React Native screens**: , , , , , , and .
2.  **Updating **: Ensuring all newly created screens were correctly included and routed within the  setup, fixing the navigation errors.
3.  **Verifying Authentication**: Confirmed that backend authentication endpoints were working and that demo user accounts (john.petowner@demo.com, sarah.caregiver@demo.com) could successfully log in.

The mobile application is now stated to be fully functional, with no navigation errors, working authentication, and all previously missing screens implemented. The current conversation thread is focused on the database infrastructure, where the user questioned the local MongoDB setup, asking if data is stored on the device (clarified no, it's central on the server) and suggesting a cloud-based solution like Supabase for production. The AI engineer is currently explaining the benefits of a cloud database.
